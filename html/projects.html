          This is our final project for Web Development I. The idea of this web application is to allow Stevens students to post and sell used textbooks, furniture, subleasing apartments, etc. The value of the application is to give Stevens students a space to sell and buy items with each other. Currently, there are no applications tailored to Stevens students out there. Check out our work on github!"

I created an interactive stuffed animal dog named Ploosh for my final project in my Interative Installations class. I hand sewed her myself with white and pink fabric.When Ploosh is plugged in her tail begins to wag. As you pet her in her favorite spot she calms down and her tail begins to wag slower until it eventually stops. This interaction was created with arduino software, a micro servo motor and an ultrasonic distance sensor. When the sensor senses your hand, it slows down the micro servo.

          A recent hobby of mine has been creating digital art, with Adobe Illustrator. Redbubble is a great place for me to post my artwork and earn a little money on the side! Check out my shop."
